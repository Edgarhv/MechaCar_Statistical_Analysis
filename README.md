# Overview

* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

# Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
##### vehicle length.
##### Ground clearance.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
##### No, because we can see above from the equation of the linear model that all coefficients of our predictor variables are non-zero, therefore the slope of our linear model is non-zero.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
##### Yes I do, because the linear model has an r-squared value of 0.7149, therefore 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model.

# suspension coil summary statistics

In the image above of design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils, we can see that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. 

* Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
##### It doesn't, because the third lot has a higher than normal variance at 170.2861224, and the total summary variance is 62.29356, but the variances for Lot1 and Lot2 are within design specifications.

# T-Tests on Suspension Coils

##### We can see in the image above that there is no evidence of rejecting the null hypothesis because the true mean of the sample is 1498.78 and a p-Value of 0.06. 

## Individual Lots
### Lot 1
##### There is not sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis assuming our significance level and with a p-Value of 1.

### Lot 2
##### The p-Value is 0.61 and the outcome with a sample mean of 1500.02. Therefore the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.

### Lot 3
##### There is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis because the sample mean is 1496.14 and the p-Value is 0.04, which is lower than the common significance level of 0.05.

# Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

* What metric or metrics are you going to test?

##### Selling price - Dependent variable + Highway fuel efficiency - Independent variable + Maintenance cost - Independent variable + MPG - Independent variable + Safety rating - Independent variable
